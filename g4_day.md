The forgetting curve is
y=1.84/((logt)^1.25+1.84)

y is forggetting amount and t is time. base of log is 10.

(wiki)
t(min) is 9460800 in 18 years.

so, the amount we want to solve is 
âˆ®[0~9460800]N*1.84/((logt)^1.25+1.84)dt

if N is the amount of memory that we can get in one min.

If I set N to 10^10, the answer of real value in integral is 
5.5*10^15

4GB is 4*10^9 bite, so the amount we need is about 10^4 USB memories.


This time, N is not exact amount, so you can adjust N to find more accurate.

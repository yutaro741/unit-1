# This is answer of quiz 015

You can know the cpened door has an odd number of divisors. 
Those number is only square numbers. 
Therefore, things you need to do is count how many square number 1~N has. 
You can easely get [âˆšN] is the answer.


```.py
def squares(n):
    return (int(n**(1/2))) #simple is the best!!!!!


def door(n):
    all = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        a = 1
        s = 0
        while a <= i:
            if i % a == 0:
                s += 1
            a += 1
        if s % 2 == 1:
            all += 1
    return all.    #Not good coding!!!!


l = [10, 100, 200, 5678]
for i in l:
    print(f"{i}, {squares(i)}")


```

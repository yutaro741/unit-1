When it is perfect, the data is natural number. 
You can write that number 100a+10b+c (a, b, c is narural number and 1≤(a,b)≤9)
100a+10b+c=b+c
100a+9b=0
Therefore, a=b=0 and its just asking it is one digit or not.

```.py
num_1 = input() #get the data
out = "No perfect" 
if num_1.isdigit(): #Find out it is number or not
    num_1 = int(num_1) 
    if 0 <= num_1 < 10: #Find out it is only one digit
        out = "perfect"
print(out)
```

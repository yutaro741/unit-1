## This is answer of 002

```.py

#Find the two number or that sum is equal to 20.
#Print true or false if there is 20 or not.
a = int(input("please input the number "))
b = int(input("please input the number "))
if a == 20 or b == 20 or a+b == 20:
  print("TRUE")
else:
  print("FALSE")
  print("FALSE")
  
```

I didn't finished but you can understand:
HL

```.py
#HL things. Do same things by list.
#you can change a and b to check it.
a = [1,3,3]
b = [19,30,50]
if 20 in a or 20 in b:
  print("TRUE")
else:
  for i in range(3):
    if a[i] + b[i] == 20:
      print("TRUE")
    else:
      print("FALSE")
#this will appear several false and some true if it true.
```
